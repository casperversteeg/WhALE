WhALE is an FSI module for Moose

Fluid solvers default in Moose are acceptable for laminar flow only, so it's
going to be a bit challenging to get all of the turbulence--will need to read
around turbulence modeling and then implement the corresponding kernels in
Moose.

Implementing FSI with an ALE formulation requires the interpolation of boundary
conditions from the fluid to the structure domain, and adjusting the mesh in
both domains. The mesh movement adds an additional convective term based on
the mesh velocity that will need to be implemented.

The code will do the following:

--Solve structure, get deflection and stress of structure based on BCs (might
    be trivial)
--Move fluid boundary according to solid deformation.
--Regularize fluid mesh, get mesh velocity based on timestep difference of mesh
--Solve fluid, get velocity and pressure based on BCs, must include additional
    convection due to mesh movement
--Stress continuity (pressure and viscous) from fluid to solid domain, as well
    as material velocity.
--Solve structure, etc.

Alternatively, instead of this staggered approach, can do a fixed point iter-
ative scheme to converge to a solution in a timestep. In this case, will need
to have a guess for the deflection and mesh movement (i.e. convection
velocity term), then get a fluid stress based on that, and go back and forth
until the stress or deflection is continuous between fluid and solid domains.
This can take the form of a penalty method kind of solver, once we understand
that better, and how performance is traded between various schemes.

What do we need:
 * Interpolation scheme from boundary to boundary, which may be irregular, and
    normal vectors may not be easy to get because of discontinuities
 * Mesh regularizer with a couple of options for specific scheme that computes
    mesh velocity
 * Some way to couple the mesh convection velocity into the fluid solver
 * Better viscoelastic models for the larynx
 * Fixed point iterative solver
