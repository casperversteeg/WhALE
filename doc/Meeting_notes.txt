[MEETING NOTES 2019/08/07]:

Ratio of advection to diffusion becomes large
mesh resolution isn't able to capture high gradients in fields
SUPG provides artificial diffusivity to stabilize

ramp up velocity (Reynolds number, really) at inlet over time
  -- may need to decrease timestep (quite probably actually)
  -- if it's slowly enough possibly not

move to material properties for fluid and solid that are more physical

In parallel also make a 3D model

Eddy length scales in turbulence (implement LES?)
  -- resolve large eddies only, but cascade energy like the littler ones are there
  -- Look at DNS Vs. LES

Do the homework:
  -- Figure out Reynolds numbers for the flow we want
  -- What are the eddy lengthscales etc...
